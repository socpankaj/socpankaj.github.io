> Cybersecurity is not a technical problem. It is a business risk problem.

My work sits at the intersection of threat intelligence, adversary behavior analysis, and strategic risk reduction. 

Over the years, I have led and contributed to investigations involving phishing ecosystems, credential theft operations, exposed cloud infrastructure, and organized fraud campaigns targeting financial and enterprise environments.

Each engagement reinforced one reality: attackers scale through automation and coordination — defenders must scale through intelligence and structure.

I focus on understanding adversaries as systems. Infrastructure mapping, campaign clustering, dark web intelligence tracking, and detection engineering are not isolated tasks; they are components of a broader objective — building visibility that informs executive decision-making.

My approach is rooted in three principles:

- Intelligence before reaction

- Structure before scale

- Measurable impact over activity

I specialize in converting raw threat signals into operational clarity. Whether analyzing large credential leak datasets, identifying coordinated threat campaign networks, hunting threat profiles and reaching out them for more context and objective, or designing detection workflows, the goal is always the same — reduce uncertainty and strengthen defensive posture at scale.

I operate with a strategic lens. Security must align with business continuity, brand protection, and financial resilience. Intelligence should not remain confined to reports; it should shape architecture decisions, influence policy, and guide investment priorities.

## Core areas of focus include:

- Threat Intelligence Strategy and Engineering

- Phishing and Fraud Infrastructure Disruption

- Dark Web Intelligence and Data Exposure Governance

- Detection Engineering and Automation at Scale

- Risk-informed Security Operations

I believe modern security leadership demands more than technical competence. It requires clarity under pressure, disciplined execution, and the ability to translate adversary behavior into board-level risk context.
